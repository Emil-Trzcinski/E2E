**The practice task:**

Automate the test scenario using Selenide (Java):

1. Open gmail page
2. Log in as a previously created user
3. Find and open a previously prepared email from the Inbox list
4. Verify the sender, subject and content of the email
5. Log out

Complete freedom of action is expected. The evaluation will take into account:

- the workability of the script
- flexibility and adaptability of the script (how easy it is to replace part of the original data, for example - search and open another email)
- "survivability" of the script (error and exception handling)
